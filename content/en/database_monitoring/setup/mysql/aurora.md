## Install the Agent

<p></p>

## Configure the Agent

The Agent must connect to the AWS Aurora _instance endpoint_.  AWS Aurora also provides a _cluster endpoint_ which allows client applications to connect to a reader or writer instance without knowledge of the underlying database host. Although using the cluster endpoint is desirable for applications, the Agent must be aware of all instances.

### Proxies, load balancers, and connection poolers

The Agent must connect directly to the host being monitored. The Agent should not connect to the database through a proxy, load balancer, or connection pooler such as `pgbouncer`. While this can be an anti-pattern for client applications, each Agent must have knowledge of the underlying hostname and should be "sticky" to a single host, even in cases of failover. If the Datadog Agent connects to different hosts while it is running, the value of metrics will be incorrect.

## Troubleshooting

If you have installed and configured the integrations and Agent as described and it is not working as expected, see [Troubleshooting][1]
